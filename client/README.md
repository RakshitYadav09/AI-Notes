Material UI client

This client has been converted to use Material UI instead of #removed/Shadcn.

Quick start (run from project root):

1. Install dependencies for client

```powershell
cd "c:/code/AI Notes/client"
npm install
```

2. Start the client

```powershell
npm start
```

Notes:
- Backend server should be running at http://localhost:5000 (or update `API` in `src/App.jsx`).
- #removed and Shadcn components were removed because #removed compilation was not working in this workspace.
