# Approach, Process, and Tech Stack

## Approach
- Use the MERN stack for rapid development and scalability.
- Use Shadcn UI for fast, accessible, and clean UI components.
- Integrate Gemini API for AI summarization.
- Keep the frontend minimal and focus on core functionality.

## Process
1. Scaffold backend (Express, MongoDB models, Gemini integration, email endpoint)
2. Scaffold frontend (React, Shadcn UI, file upload, prompt input, summary editor, email form)
3. Connect frontend and backend
4. Test end-to-end
5. Deploy (instructions to be added)

## Tech Stack
- React, Shadcn UI, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Gemini API, Nodemailer

## Deployment
- Will use a service like Vercel (frontend) and Render or Railway (backend)
- MongoDB Atlas for database

## Notes
- API keys and secrets will be stored in environment variables
- Documentation will be updated as the project progresses
